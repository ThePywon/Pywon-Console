Hello, this is a little project of mine I made for fun.
Its a console wich can execute some .js files in the Games folder.

You can add your own game in there by including a line of code like that in there:
window.Game = {name:"Game name", author:"Your name", desc:"Some description"};

To run it just type:
/execute Filename
in the console.

You can use the console yourself using 'Log("text", "CSScolor")' and 'LogError("text")'

Last thing I must tell you is that to run the console you have to go to the Scripts folder and open 'main.html'

Have a very nice day.
